**Satellite Imagery-Based Property Valuation**

This project predicts house prices using a **multimodal approach**, combining:
- **Tabular features** (size, rooms, location, etc.)
- **Satellite images** (neighborhood context from Sentinel-2)

The goal is not only prediction accuracy, but also **interpretability** using Grad-CAM to understand *what the model looks at* in satellite images.
